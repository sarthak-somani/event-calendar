Speaker's webpage: https://chep.iisc.ac.in/Personnel/pages/anant/index.html Abstract: In this talk, we shall discuss the project of knowledge production as a profession and as a career, and the calling of a professional. We will present general arguments by looking into some contemporary examples drawn from different disciplines. We will described at a popular level recent discoveries such as gravitational waves which unites physics at the largest and smallest scales and the discovery of the Higgs boson which required a heroic man made machine. We will appeal to other examples from mathematics, computer science, biology, climate science, to name a few to motivate the challenges of the present era. We will also look into the issues of the psychology of creativity. Of importance are also questions of science and engineering in India as a developing country and that of representation of women among others. We will also touch on important issues of the role of the individual, of working in teams, and of communication. Stated differently this talk aims to provide a motivational framework and spells out the gestalt needed for a young person to enter the daunting field of research and discovery and to be a part of the great discoveries that lie ahead. The talk is aimed at a very broad audience and is accessible even to class XI and XII students, and for students across all B. Tech, M.Sc, Ph.D. students in all branches of sciences, and also to teachers and researchers in all areas of science. The speaker is well suited for this as someone with experience in both engineering and science. We wish to leave a lot of time for discussion at the end of the talk and encourage participation from all, young and not so young.",

            "description": "Facing a critical water shortage from deforestation, Shri Chaitram Pawar united his village thirty-five years ago. They banned grazing and firewood cutting, and built 450 small bunds to capture rainwater. The results were transformative: nine new _ponds_ rejuvenated wells and groundwater. A hamlet that once fetched water from 5 km away now supplies five villages. Reliable water enabled double-cropping, ending migration and boosting the economy. The community later secured forest rights for 44 villages, which now manage their own conservation programs. Chaitramji's lifelong dedication to transforming his region through community-led water and forest conservation has promoted sustainable village development. His work with the Baripada Gram Vikas Samitee has revitalized agriculture, improved groundwater levels, and restored the dignity of the tribal community by building a self-reliant model village in Nandurbar, Maharashtra. Shri Chaitram Devchand Pawar is a distinguished social worker and environmental conservationist with over three decades of dedicated service to tribal and rural communities. Beginning his journey with the Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram, he now oversees impactful work across over 100 villages in Maharashtra and Gujarat as the Regional Head for the Marathwada and Khandesh divisions. His leadership has significantly expanded the scope of this work, which now operates through 14 clusters spanning 6 states. His innovative community-driven livelihood and leadership development model has been widely recognized and adopted by other organizations across the Western Ghats. He is the first recipient of Maharashtra's Van Bhushan Puraskar recognized in 2024 for his significant contributions to forest conservation, sustainable development, and social reform in Maharashtra. He is a recipient of the Padma Shri award, for his work with forest-dwelling tribes, focusing on self-reliance, natural resource conservation, and the implementation of the Forest Rights Act. In recognition of his expertise, he was appointed as an Expert Member on the Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change, Government of India, in 2015. Despite international recognition such as the IFAD International Prize and the \"Aadivasi Mitra\" award, and despite holding key roles in state and central government committees, he remains detached from the limelight.",

They banned grazing and firewood cutting, and built 450 small bunds to capture rainwater. The results were transformative: nine new ponds rejuvenated wells and groundwater. A hamlet that once fetched water from 5 km away now supplies five villages. Reliable water enabled double-cropping, ending migration and boosting the economy. The community later secured forest rights for 44 villages, which now manage their own conservation programs. Chaitramji's lifelong dedication to transforming his region through community-led water and forest conservation has promoted sustainable village development. His work with the Baripada Gram Vikas Samitee has revitalized agriculture, improved groundwater levels, and restored the dignity of the tribal community by building a self-reliant model village in Nandurbar, Maharashtra. Shri Chaitram Devchand Pawar is a distinguished social worker and environmental conservationist with over three decades of dedicated service to tribal and rural communities. Beginning his journey with the Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram, he now oversees impactful work across over 100 villages in Maharashtra and Gujarat as the Regional Head for the Marathwada and Khandesh divisions. His leadership has significantly expanded the scope of this work, which now operates through 14 clusters spanning 6 states. His innovative community-driven livelihood and leadership development model has been widely recognized and adopted by other organizations across the Western Ghats. He is the first recipient of Maharashtra's Van Bhushan Puraskar recognized in 2024 for his significant contributions to forest conservation, sustainable development, and social reform in Maharashtra.

They banned grazing and firewood cutting, and built 450 small bunds to capture rainwater. The results were transformative: nine new ponds rejuvenated wells and groundwater. A hamlet that once fetched water from 5 km away now supplies five villages. Reliable water enabled double-cropping, ending migration and boosting the economy. The community later secured forest rights for 44 villages, which now manage their own conservation programs. Chaitramji's lifelong dedication to transforming his region through community-led water and forest conservation has promoted sustainable village development. His work with the Baripada Gram Vikas Samitee has revitalized agriculture, improved groundwater levels, and restored the dignity of the tribal community by building a self-reliant model village in Nandurbar, Maharashtra. Shri Chaitram Devchand Pawar is a distinguished social worker and environmental conservationist with over three decades of dedicated service to tribal and rural communities. Beginning his journey with the Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram, he now oversees impactful work across over 100 villages in Maharashtra and Gujarat as the Regional Head for the Marathwada and Khandesh divisions. His leadership has significantly expanded the scope of this work, which now operates through 14 clusters spanning 6 states. His innovative community-driven livelihood and leadership development model has been widely recognized and adopted by other organizations across the Western Ghats. He is the first recipient of Maharashtra's Van Bhushan Puraskar recognized in 2024 for his significant contributions to forest conservation, sustainable development, and social reform in Maharashtra. He is a recipient of the Padma Shri award, for his work with forest-dwelling tribes, focusing on self-reliance, natural resource conservation, and the implementation of the Forest Rights Act. In recognition of his expertise, he was appointed as an Expert Member on the Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change, Government of India, in 2015. Despite international recognition such as the IFAD International Prize and the \"Aadivasi Mitra\" award, and despite holding key roles in state and central government committees, he remains detached from the limelight.",

Today, the global particle physics community at CERN is shaping the next European Strategy for Particle Physics, a process that may chart the course toward a new flagship collider to succeed the LHC. In this colloquium, I will review where we stand in our understanding of the fundamental building blocks of matter, explain how long-term strategy in our field is developed, and highlight some of the outstanding questions about the Universe that we hope to address in the years ahead.",

            "description": "The efficiency of single-junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is reaching the practical limit with current certified record efficiency of 26.95%. While achieving long-term stability in such cells remains a challenge, many companies are testing large panels in outdoor applications. As the perovskite solar cells are commercialized it is time for researchers to look beyond photovoltaic properties. Perovskite quantum dots offer new opportunities to tailor light energy harvesting and photon management.1-5 Steering energy transfer pathways in semiconductor nanocrystal-dye assembly is important in designing semiconductor-multi chromophoric films for display devices. Such hybrid films can down convert or up convert incident photons and deliver emission at desired wavelengths. By selecting high energy donor (e.g., CsPbBr3) one can down convert the incident photons through an energy transfer cascade, as in the case of CsPbBr3-rubrene-DBP system to populate singlet excited DBP (perylene derivative). On the other hand, when the donor energy is low as in the case of CsPbI3-rubrene-DBP, one can populate singlet DBP via triplet-triplet annihilation. Thus, by steering energy transfer pathways, it is possible to manage the photon flow and obtain desired emission output. Another application of semiconductor QDs is in photocatalysis. Bandgap engineering of perovskite nanocrystals provides a unique handle to modulate the charge transfer interactions with acceptor molecules. Aromatic amines are useful probes to extract photogenerated holes from perovskite nanocrystals of varying bandgap. The efficiency and rate of hole transfer is governed by energy level alignment of semiconductor donor-molecular acceptor. The rate constant of hole transfer (0.15-2.2\u00d7109 s-1) dependence on the thermodynamic driving force -G, follows Marcus electron transfer theory with a reorganization energy of ~1 eV. Spectroscopic and kinetics results that provide new insights into interfacial charge transfer process in semiconductor-acceptor systems will be discussed.

            "description": "Abstract:\nMacromolecular crowding profoundly shapes intracellular phase behavior, yet the absence of a universal metric for crowding strength limits our ability to compare and predict phase separation across different systems. Here, we use the well-characterized bovine serum albumin (BSA)\u2013polyethylene glycol (PEG) system to dissect the physics of depletion-induced phase separation under crowding. By mapping full phase diagrams for BSA in the presence of PEG of varying molecular weights and polydispersity, we show that the observed behavior is quantitatively captured by Generalized Free Volume Theory (GFVT). Crucially, we identify an entropic crowd- ing parameter \u2014 the ratio of PEG volume fraction to the polymer-excluded volume fraction \u2014 that collapses the data across a range of PEG sizes onto a single master curve. This scaling captures the thermodynamics of crowding-induced LLPS independently of crowder size and covers a broad range of proteins beyond BSA, revealing that protein solubility under crowding is governed by the polymer's occupancy of accessible free volume. Our findings establish a universal control parameter for PEG-induced entropic crowding, enabling quantitative comparison of phase behavior across experimental and physiological contexts.  \n\nAbout the speaker:\nProf. Rebane has completed his PhD in Physics at Yale University. During his doctoral work, Prof. Rebane used single-molecule optical tweezers to study the assembly of SNARE proteins. His postdoctoral research at the Yale School of Medicine focused on how liquid\u2013liquid phase separation of membrane proteins might shape and maintain the architecture of the Golgi Apparatus. He worked at ETH Z\u00fcrich to study the emergent properties of metabolically active droplets of phase-separated proteins, where he was awarded the Ambizione grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation. His primary research areas include: Soft Matter Physics, Single-Molecule Biophysics, Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation, Optical Tweezers, and Intracellular Trafficking.

They are incredibly abundant--trillions pass through our bodies every second--yet they interact so weakly with matter that they are notoriously difficult to detect. Despite this elusiveness, neutrinos have already transformed our understanding of nature: the discovery of neutrino oscillations showed that these particles have mass, a result that required physics beyond the original Standard Model of Particle Physics. Neutrinos have come a long way: once considered impossible to detect, they now take center stage in particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. In this colloquium, we highlight how precision neutrino physics is shaping our understanding of nature and how neutrinos have become versatile astrophysical messengers, but also how neutrinos can be a real nuisance in searches for other rare particle physics processes. Along the way, we highlight some of the theoretical challenges we face in modern neutrino physics. Speaker: Prof. Dr. Joachim Kopp, a professor at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz who specializes in theoretical astroparticle physics. He is a leading expert in theoretical neutrino physics.",
