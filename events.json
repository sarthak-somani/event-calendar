Speaker's webpage: https://chep.iisc.ac.in/Personnel/pages/anant/index.html Abstract: In this talk, we shall discuss the project of knowledge production as a profession and as a career, and the calling of a professional. We will present general arguments by looking into some contemporary examples drawn from different disciplines. We will described at a popular level recent discoveries such as gravitational waves which unites physics at the largest and smallest scales and the discovery of the Higgs boson which required a heroic man made machine. We will appeal to other examples from mathematics, computer science, biology, climate science, to name a few to motivate the challenges of the present era. We will also look into the issues of the psychology of creativity. Of importance are also questions of science and engineering in India as a developing country and that of representation of women among others. We will also touch on important issues of the role of the individual, of working in teams, and of communication. Stated differently this talk aims to provide a motivational framework and spells out the gestalt needed for a young person to enter the daunting field of research and discovery and to be a part of the great discoveries that lie ahead. The talk is aimed at a very broad audience and is accessible even to class XI and XII students, and for students across all B. Tech, M.Sc, Ph.D. students in all branches of sciences, and also to teachers and researchers in all areas of science. The speaker is well suited for this as someone with experience in both engineering and science. We wish to leave a lot of time for discussion at the end of the talk and encourage participation from all, young and not so young.",

            "description": "Facing a critical water shortage from deforestation, Shri Chaitram Pawar united his village thirty-five years ago. They banned grazing and firewood cutting, and built 450 small bunds to capture rainwater. The results were transformative: nine new _ponds_ rejuvenated wells and groundwater. A hamlet that once fetched water from 5 km away now supplies five villages. Reliable water enabled double-cropping, ending migration and boosting the economy. The community later secured forest rights for 44 villages, which now manage their own conservation programs. Chaitramji's lifelong dedication to transforming his region through community-led water and forest conservation has promoted sustainable village development. His work with the Baripada Gram Vikas Samitee has revitalized agriculture, improved groundwater levels, and restored the dignity of the tribal community by building a self-reliant model village in Nandurbar, Maharashtra. Shri Chaitram Devchand Pawar is a distinguished social worker and environmental conservationist with over three decades of dedicated service to tribal and rural communities. Beginning his journey with the Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram, he now oversees impactful work across over 100 villages in Maharashtra and Gujarat as the Regional Head for the Marathwada and Khandesh divisions. His leadership has significantly expanded the scope of this work, which now operates through 14 clusters spanning 6 states. His innovative community-driven livelihood and leadership development model has been widely recognized and adopted by other organizations across the Western Ghats. He is the first recipient of Maharashtra's Van Bhushan Puraskar recognized in 2024 for his significant contributions to forest conservation, sustainable development, and social reform in Maharashtra. He is a recipient of the Padma Shri award, for his work with forest-dwelling tribes, focusing on self-reliance, natural resource conservation, and the implementation of the Forest Rights Act. In recognition of his expertise, he was appointed as an Expert Member on the Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change, Government of India, in 2015. Despite international recognition such as the IFAD International Prize and the \"Aadivasi Mitra\" award, and despite holding key roles in state and central government committees, he remains detached from the limelight.",

They banned grazing and firewood cutting, and built 450 small bunds to capture rainwater. The results were transformative: nine new ponds rejuvenated wells and groundwater. A hamlet that once fetched water from 5 km away now supplies five villages. Reliable water enabled double-cropping, ending migration and boosting the economy. The community later secured forest rights for 44 villages, which now manage their own conservation programs. Chaitramji's lifelong dedication to transforming his region through community-led water and forest conservation has promoted sustainable village development. His work with the Baripada Gram Vikas Samitee has revitalized agriculture, improved groundwater levels, and restored the dignity of the tribal community by building a self-reliant model village in Nandurbar, Maharashtra. Shri Chaitram Devchand Pawar is a distinguished social worker and environmental conservationist with over three decades of dedicated service to tribal and rural communities. Beginning his journey with the Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram, he now oversees impactful work across over 100 villages in Maharashtra and Gujarat as the Regional Head for the Marathwada and Khandesh divisions. His leadership has significantly expanded the scope of this work, which now operates through 14 clusters spanning 6 states. His innovative community-driven livelihood and leadership development model has been widely recognized and adopted by other organizations across the Western Ghats. He is the first recipient of Maharashtra's Van Bhushan Puraskar recognized in 2024 for his significant contributions to forest conservation, sustainable development, and social reform in Maharashtra.

They banned grazing and firewood cutting, and built 450 small bunds to capture rainwater. The results were transformative: nine new ponds rejuvenated wells and groundwater. A hamlet that once fetched water from 5 km away now supplies five villages. Reliable water enabled double-cropping, ending migration and boosting the economy. The community later secured forest rights for 44 villages, which now manage their own conservation programs. Chaitramji's lifelong dedication to transforming his region through community-led water and forest conservation has promoted sustainable village development. His work with the Baripada Gram Vikas Samitee has revitalized agriculture, improved groundwater levels, and restored the dignity of the tribal community by building a self-reliant model village in Nandurbar, Maharashtra. Shri Chaitram Devchand Pawar is a distinguished social worker and environmental conservationist with over three decades of dedicated service to tribal and rural communities. Beginning his journey with the Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram, he now oversees impactful work across over 100 villages in Maharashtra and Gujarat as the Regional Head for the Marathwada and Khandesh divisions. His leadership has significantly expanded the scope of this work, which now operates through 14 clusters spanning 6 states. His innovative community-driven livelihood and leadership development model has been widely recognized and adopted by other organizations across the Western Ghats. He is the first recipient of Maharashtra's Van Bhushan Puraskar recognized in 2024 for his significant contributions to forest conservation, sustainable development, and social reform in Maharashtra. He is a recipient of the Padma Shri award, for his work with forest-dwelling tribes, focusing on self-reliance, natural resource conservation, and the implementation of the Forest Rights Act. In recognition of his expertise, he was appointed as an Expert Member on the Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change, Government of India, in 2015. Despite international recognition such as the IFAD International Prize and the \"Aadivasi Mitra\" award, and despite holding key roles in state and central government committees, he remains detached from the limelight.",

Today, the global particle physics community at CERN is shaping the next European Strategy for Particle Physics, a process that may chart the course toward a new flagship collider to succeed the LHC. In this colloquium, I will review where we stand in our understanding of the fundamental building blocks of matter, explain how long-term strategy in our field is developed, and highlight some of the outstanding questions about the Universe that we hope to address in the years ahead.",

            "description": "The efficiency of single-junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is reaching the practical limit with current certified record efficiency of 26.95%. While achieving long-term stability in such cells remains a challenge, many companies are testing large panels in outdoor applications. As the perovskite solar cells are commercialized it is time for researchers to look beyond photovoltaic properties. Perovskite quantum dots offer new opportunities to tailor light energy harvesting and photon management.1-5 Steering energy transfer pathways in semiconductor nanocrystal-dye assembly is important in designing semiconductor-multi chromophoric films for display devices. Such hybrid films can down convert or up convert incident photons and deliver emission at desired wavelengths. By selecting high energy donor (e.g., CsPbBr3) one can down convert the incident photons through an energy transfer cascade, as in the case of CsPbBr3-rubrene-DBP system to populate singlet excited DBP (perylene derivative). On the other hand, when the donor energy is low as in the case of CsPbI3-rubrene-DBP, one can populate singlet DBP via triplet-triplet annihilation. Thus, by steering energy transfer pathways, it is possible to manage the photon flow and obtain desired emission output. Another application of semiconductor QDs is in photocatalysis. Bandgap engineering of perovskite nanocrystals provides a unique handle to modulate the charge transfer interactions with acceptor molecules. Aromatic amines are useful probes to extract photogenerated holes from perovskite nanocrystals of varying bandgap. The efficiency and rate of hole transfer is governed by energy level alignment of semiconductor donor-molecular acceptor. The rate constant of hole transfer (0.15-2.2\u00d7109 s-1) dependence on the thermodynamic driving force -G, follows Marcus electron transfer theory with a reorganization energy of ~1 eV. Spectroscopic and kinetics results that provide new insights into interfacial charge transfer process in semiconductor-acceptor systems will be discussed.

            "description": "Abstract:\nMacromolecular crowding profoundly shapes intracellular phase behavior, yet the absence of a universal metric for crowding strength limits our ability to compare and predict phase separation across different systems. Here, we use the well-characterized bovine serum albumin (BSA)\u2013polyethylene glycol (PEG) system to dissect the physics of depletion-induced phase separation under crowding. By mapping full phase diagrams for BSA in the presence of PEG of varying molecular weights and polydispersity, we show that the observed behavior is quantitatively captured by Generalized Free Volume Theory (GFVT). Crucially, we identify an entropic crowd- ing parameter \u2014 the ratio of PEG volume fraction to the polymer-excluded volume fraction \u2014 that collapses the data across a range of PEG sizes onto a single master curve. This scaling captures the thermodynamics of crowding-induced LLPS independently of crowder size and covers a broad range of proteins beyond BSA, revealing that protein solubility under crowding is governed by the polymer's occupancy of accessible free volume. Our findings establish a universal control parameter for PEG-induced entropic crowding, enabling quantitative comparison of phase behavior across experimental and physiological contexts.  \n\nAbout the speaker:\nProf. Rebane has completed his PhD in Physics at Yale University. During his doctoral work, Prof. Rebane used single-molecule optical tweezers to study the assembly of SNARE proteins. His postdoctoral research at the Yale School of Medicine focused on how liquid\u2013liquid phase separation of membrane proteins might shape and maintain the architecture of the Golgi Apparatus. He worked at ETH Z\u00fcrich to study the emergent properties of metabolically active droplets of phase-separated proteins, where he was awarded the Ambizione grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation. His primary research areas include: Soft Matter Physics, Single-Molecule Biophysics, Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation, Optical Tweezers, and Intracellular Trafficking.

They are incredibly abundant--trillions pass through our bodies every second--yet they interact so weakly with matter that they are notoriously difficult to detect. Despite this elusiveness, neutrinos have already transformed our understanding of nature: the discovery of neutrino oscillations showed that these particles have mass, a result that required physics beyond the original Standard Model of Particle Physics. Neutrinos have come a long way: once considered impossible to detect, they now take center stage in particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. In this colloquium, we highlight how precision neutrino physics is shaping our understanding of nature and how neutrinos have become versatile astrophysical messengers, but also how neutrinos can be a real nuisance in searches for other rare particle physics processes. Along the way, we highlight some of the theoretical challenges we face in modern neutrino physics. Speaker: Prof. Dr. Joachim Kopp, a professor at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz who specializes in theoretical astroparticle physics.

Early on during development, however, neurons look round and simple without signs of their future complexity. How do neurons develop their sophisticated structure? How do they initially generate domains that later have distinct functions within neuronal circuits, such as the axon? Can a better understanding of the underlying developmental mechanisms help us in pathological conditions, such as a spinal cord injury, to induce axons to regenerate? Here, Prof. Frank will talk about the cytoskeleton as a driving force for initial neuronal polarization and axon growth. He will then explore how cytoskeletal changes help to reactivate the growth program of injured CNS axons to elicit axon regeneration after a spinal cord injury. Finally, he will discuss whether axon growth and synapse formation could represent mutually excluding processes. Pursuing this developmental hypothesis has helped his group to generate a novel perspective on regeneration failure in the adult CNS and to provide new paths to overcome this. Thus, this talk will describe how we can utilize developmental mechanisms to induce axon regeneration in the adult spinal cord following injury.",

They are incredibly abundant--trillions pass through our bodies every second--yet they interact so weakly with matter that they are notoriously difficult to detect. Despite this elusiveness, neutrinos have already transformed our understanding of nature: the discovery of neutrino oscillations showed that these particles have mass, a result that required physics beyond the original Standard Model of Particle Physics. Neutrinos have come a long way: once considered impossible to detect, they now take center stage in particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. In this colloquium, we highlight how precision neutrino physics is shaping our understanding of nature and how neutrinos have become versatile astrophysical messengers, but also how neutrinos can be a real nuisance in searches for other rare particle physics processes. Along the way, we highlight some of the theoretical challenges we face in modern neutrino physics.",

In less than a decade, detections by LIGO and Virgo have revealed unexpected populations of black holes and neutron stars, challenging long-standing ideas of how massive stars form, evolve, and die. Gravitational-wave observations have also provided an unprecedented view of dense matter, a new tool for cosmology and unveiled new tests of general relativity confirming the Hawking Area Law and the Kerr nature of black holes. Yet current detectors can probe only the nearby Universe. Next-generation observatories--Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope--will open access to black hole mergers at cosmic dawn and neutron star mergers beyond the epoch of peak star formation. Together, they promise discoveries that will reshape astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics.",

NASA's 1995 Environmental Charter identified a fourfold reduction in jet noise within 25 years as one of its Three Pillars of Success. This lecture highlights innovative jet noise reduction concepts and technologies that Dr. Mengle conceived and experimentally validated during his 35+ years of career at Boeing, Rolls-Royce, GE and Aero Insights. Among them are the now-familiar serrations on engine nozzle lips, known as chevrons, and their adaptive versions made from shape-memory alloys (SMA)--tested at model scale and in full-scale flight tests, and now featured on aircraft such as the Boeing 747-8 and 737 MAX. The pioneering advances he made in lobe-mixer designs to reduce jet noise in supersonic planes and medium-thrust engines will also be presented. Jet noise control blends aerodynamics, acoustics, materials science, and environmental engineering, where experiments often guide theory. The talk will show how first-principles physics and creative experimentation can lead to practical designs that help make commercial aviation quieter and more sustainable.",

He is an internationally well-known research engineer and inventor in aeroacoustics, specializing in aircraft jet noise reduction, best known for conceiving the Azimuthally Varying Chevrons. The lecture will highlight innovative jet noise reduction concepts and technologies that Dr. Mengle conceived and experimentally validated during his 35+ years of career at Boeing, Rolls-Royce, GE and Aero Insights. Among them are the now-familiar serrations on engine nozzle lips, known as chevrons, and their adaptive versions made from shape-memory alloys (SMA). The pioneering advances he made in lobe-mixer designs to reduce jet noise in supersonic planes and medium-thrust engines will also be presented. The talk will show how first-principles physics and creative experimentation can lead to practical designs that help make commercial aviation quieter and more sustainable.",

Abhay has been involved and led nuclear/particle physics experiments at BNL (Upton, NY, USA), CERN (Geneva, Switzerland), DESY (Hamburg, Germany), Jefferson Laboratory (Newport News, Virginia, USA), and PSI (Zurich, Switzerland). He is one of the first proponents of the Electron Ion Collider (EIC) at the time called the eRHIC since 1996, and has been a leader in developing the EIC science, making the case for it, initiating, and organizing the Users Community and detector collaborations around this project.\n\nProf. Abhay received his Master's in physics from Indian Institute of Technology (Kanpur, India) in 1987, Ph.D. from Yale University in experimental high-energy particle physics in 1994. After spending four years at CERN and DESY as a postdoctoral fellow and research scientist, he became a Fellow of the RIKEN BNL Research Center at BNL in 2000. He moved to Stony Brook University as tenure track Assistant Professor at Stony Brook University in 2004, promoted to Associate Professor with tenure in 2008, Professor in 2013, and finally appointed State University of New York's highest professorship, \"Distinguished Professor\" in 2021. Abhay is a Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS, 2014) and American Association for Advancement of Science (AAAS, 2021). He is a recipient of a Special Prize by the President of RIKEN for his research at RHIC (2015), SUNY Chancellor's Award for Excellence in Research & Innovation (2018), IIT Kanpur's Distinguished Alumnus Award (2021). Abhay was inducted into NY State's Distinguished Academy (2022). Abhay serves on the advisory boards of various national and international conferences, research centers and institutions. Abhay is a life member of the American Association for Advancement of Science (AAAS) and American Physical Society (APS).\n\nProf. Abhay Deshpande works in experimental nuclear and high energy physics. His current research includes various exploratory and precision studies in QCD using polarized proton-proton, proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus beams of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island; and high intensity polarized electron beams of the recently upgraded Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory, in Newport News, Virginia. He has been involved deeply in the development of the science and promotion of the future Electron Ion Collider.\n\nDespite half a century of international research, scientists still understand very little about the interactions between quarks and gluons inside protons and neutrons especially when they are in large numbers. For instance, adding up the masses of quarks and gluons accounts for only about 1% of a proton's total mass and roughly half of its spin. Where does the rest come from? The answer likely lies in the complex dynamics of gluon interactions. To explore the gluon's role, a groundbreaking new facility--the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC)--is being built at Brookhaven National Laboratory in partnership with Jefferson Lab. This next-generation particle accelerator will collide polarized electrons with polarized protons and nuclei to produce high-resolution \"snapshots\" of their internal structure (think of a 3D MRI of the proton), enabling physicists to better understand how quarks and gluons generate mass, spin, and the fundamental properties of matter. The EIC is a global collaboration involving more than 1,500 scientists from nearly 300 institutions, including a significant contingent from India. Once operational later in the next decade, the collider is expected to revolutionize understanding of the strong nuclear force--the \"glue\" that binds the building blocks of visible matter throughout the universe. In this talk, I will outline the open questions in quark-gluon dynamics and present the current status of the EIC project that is poised to address them.",

            "description": "About the Speaker:\nProf. Chandrashekhar Khare was born in Mumbai, and studied at Cambridge, Oxford and Caltech, where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1995. He worked at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and the University of Utah and is now a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Prof. Khare's research is in number theory, especially on the relation between modular forms and Galois representations. In 2009, he and Jean-Pierre Winterberger made a remarkable breakthrough with their proof of a celebrated conjecture of J.P. Serre. Prof. Khare's honors and awards include the Fermat Prize (2007), Infosys Prize (2010) and the Cole Prize (2011), and he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2012.\n\nAbstract:\nI will trace the development of ideas from a 1916 paper of Ramanujan, to the formulation of a conjecture of Jean-Pierre Serre in the 1970's, to its resolution in 2009 in my joint work with Jean-Pierre Wintenberger. Serre's modularity conjecture was a stimulus to much work that led to developments which were crucial to the methods Andrew Wiles used in his solution in 1994 of Fermat's Last Theorem. When Wiles announced his results he had said that his methods were \"orthogonal\" to Serre's conjecture. Our proof of Serre's conjecture uses a strategy that relies crucially on Wiles's methods. The mathematics around Serre's conjecture and our solution of it remains a central area in Number Theory.\nMy mathematical memoir Chasing A Conjecture: Inside the Mind of a Mathematician talks about some of these ideas at an impressionistic level. This talk will give a more mathematical introduction to these ideas: it will flesh out the interplay of Galois and Ramanujan symmetries that are the main protagonists of my book.",

            "description": "The genome inside our cells is not a static string of DNA but a highly organized, dynamic structure shaped by biochemical reactions, physical forces, and tiny building blocks of chromatin. Recent work shows that active gene activity and epigenetic processes help organize chromatin at multiple scales -- from the mesoscale patterns revealed by super-resolution imaging and sequencing to nanoscale \"domains\" that act as hubs of transcription and regulatory activity, even in the absence of classical loop structures. These chromatin domains, visible only with advanced microscopy, appear to integrate local chemical marks with larger nuclear architecture, linking small-scale organization to global genome function. Importantly, disruptions in these organizing principles -- whether through altered mechanical cues, epigenetic misregulation, or pathological remodeling -- are increasingly observed in diseases like cancer and fibrosis, where genome structure and gene regulation go awry. Together, this body of work points to a unified, multi-scale physical and biochemical framework for genome organization with direct implications for understanding and ultimately targeting disease.",

            "description": "Rechargeable batteries have been an integral part of the portable electronics revolution and are now playing a critical role in transport and grid applications to help mitigate climate change. However, these applications come with different sets of challenges. New technologies are being investigated and fundamental science is key to producing non-incremental advances and to develop new strategies for energy storage and conversion. This lecture will provide an overview of some battery chemistries and challenges in the field, illustrating some aspects via our own work. Specifically, I will describe our development of NMR, MRI and new optical methods that allow devices to be probed while they are operating, from the local, to particle and then cell level. This allows transformations of the various cell materials to be followed under realistic conditions without having to disassemble and take apart the cell. Examples include beyond-lithium\" technologies (e.g., sodium-ion batteries, and lithium sulphur and air). Starting with local structure and dynamics, as measured by NMR, I will then show - via the optical methods - how the different dynamics can result in very different intercalation mechanisms, e.g., in graphite. NMR methods can also be used to quantify impurities in solid state battery electrolytes, to correlate impurities with transport and dendrite formation. Finally, extensions of our new metrologies to study a wider range of electrochemical systems will be described.",

            "description": "The Indian Institute of Technology Bombay is organizing an Institute Lecture on Wednesday, January 21, 2026. The speaker is Prof. Nitash P. Balsara, The Charles W. Tobias Professor in Electrochemistry, Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, California. About the Speaker: Nitash P. Balsara is a chemical engineer with a bachelor's degree from the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, India in 1982, a master's degree from Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York in 1984, and a PhD from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York in 1988. He did post-doctoral research at the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science at the University of Minnesota, and at Exxon Research and Engineering Company in Annandale, New Jersey. In 1992, he joined the faculty of Department of Chemical Engineering at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, New York. In 2000 he moved to the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, with a joint appointment at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He works at the intersection of polymer physics and electrochemical energy storage. He cofounded two battery start-ups, Seeo (purchased by Bosch) and Blue Current (currently operating with 50 employees). He received the Polymer Physics Prize (2026) and John H. Dillon Medal (1997) for Polymer Physics from the American Physical Society, the Stine Award for Materials Science from the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (2005), the Hottel Lectureship from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2015), the Van Ness and Birnboim Lectureships from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (1998 & 2025), the Charles W. Tobias Endowed Chair in Electrochemistry at the University of California, Berkeley (2014-present), the Platinum Jubilee Professor of the Indian Academy of Sciences (2014), the Distinguished Alumni Award from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (2019), and the United States Energy Secretary's Achievement Award (2018). Abstract: It is natural to focus on the movement of charged ions in electric fields. In this talk however, I will focus on the movement of neutral \"solvent\" molecules used to dissolve the ions inside batteries. Any energy used to move solvent molecules is wasted, and thus it is important to understand how and why they move. In our case, the solvent is a polymer; I believe that polymer electrolytes will play an essential role in enabling next-generation rechargeable batteries. My journey began when I learned about the continuity equation as an undergraduate student. I will describe how the continuity equation changes in the presence of an electric field. While ion velocities can be inferred from current-voltage measurements, there were no well-established approaches for measuring velocities of neutral molecules in batteries. My group (and others) have recently developed experimental approaches for accomplishing this. Surprisingly, the field-induced velocity of uncharged long polymer chains is comparable to that of the ions. If the polymer chains are crosslinked, then the movement of ions generates stress that opposes ion motion. Theoretical predictions will be compared with experimental results. In addition to continuum-scale experiments, I will describe the results of quasi-elastic neutron scattering experiments which enable the study of the motion of polymer segments in the vicinity of ions on the Angstrom length scale. These measurements and computer simulations on the same length scale provide insight into the underpinnings of continuum transport. I will conclude by describing the connection between our work on polymer electrolytes and the continuing push to commercialize all-solid rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles and other energy-related applications.",

However, these applications come with different sets of challenges. New technologies are being investigated and fundamental science is key to producing non-incremental advances and to develop new strategies for energy storage and conversion.\nThis lecture will provide an overview of some battery chemistries and challenges in the field, illustrating some aspects via our own work. Specifically, I will describe our development of NMR, MRI and new optical methods that allow devices to be probed while they are operating, from the local, to particle and then cell level. This allows transformations of the various cell materials to be followed under realistic conditions without having to disassemble and take apart the cell. Examples include beyond-lithium\" technologies (e.g., sodium-ion batteries, and lithium sulphur and air). Starting with local structure and dynamics, as measured by NMR, I will then show - via the optical methods - how the different dynamics can result in very different intercalation mechanisms, e.g., in graphite. NMR methods can also be used to quantify impurities in solid state battery electrolytes, to correlate impurities with transport and dendrite formation. Finally, extensions of our new metrologies to study a wider range of electrochemical systems will be described.",

About the Speaker: Prof. Chandrashekhar Khare was born in Mumbai, and studied at Cambridge, Oxford and Caltech, where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1995. He worked at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and the University of Utah and is now a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Prof. Khare's research is in number theory, especially on the relation between modular forms and Galois representations. In 2009, he and Jean-Pierre Winterberger made a remarkable breakthrough with their proof of a celebrated conjecture of J.P. Serre. Prof. Khare's honors and awards include the Fermat Prize (2007), Infosys Prize (2010) and the Cole Prize (2011), and he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2012. Speaker's webpage: https://www.math.ucla.edu/~shekhar/. Abstract: I will trace the development of ideas from a 1916 paper of Ramanujan, to the formulation of a conjecture of Jean-Pierre Serre in the 1970's, to its resolution in 2009 in my joint work with Jean-Pierre Wintenberger. Serre's modularity conjecture was a stimulus to much work that led to developments which were crucial to the methods Andrew Wiles used in his solution in 1994 of Fermat's Last Theorem. When Wiles announced his results he had said that his methods were ``orthogonal'' to Serre's conjecture. Our proof of Serre's conjecture uses a strategy that relies crucially on Wiles's methods. The mathematics around Serre's conjecture and our solution of it remains a central area in Number Theory. My mathematical memoir Chasing A Conjecture: Inside the Mind of a Mathematician talks about some of these ideas at an impressionistic level. This talk will give a more mathematical introduction to these ideas: it will flesh out the interplay of Galois and Ramanujan symmetries that are the main protagonists of my book.",

Balsara is a chemical engineer with a bachelor's degree from the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, India in 1982, a master's degree from Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York in 1984, and a PhD from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York in 1988. He did post-doctoral research at the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science at the University of Minnesota, and at Exxon Research and Engineering Company in Annandale, New Jersey. In 1992, he joined the faculty of Department of Chemical Engineering at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, New York. In 2000 he moved to the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, with a joint appointment at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He works at the intersection of polymer physics and electrochemical energy storage. He cofounded two battery start-ups, Seeo (purchased by Bosch) and Blue Current (currently operating with 50 employees). He received the Polymer Physics Prize (2026) and John H. Dillon Medal (1997) for Polymer Physics from the American Physical Society, the Stine Award for Materials Science from the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (2005), the Hottel Lectureship from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2015), the Van Ness and Birnboim Lectureships from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (1998 & 2025), the Charles W. Tobias Endowed Chair in Electrochemistry at the University of California, Berkeley (2014-present), the Platinum Jubilee Professor of the Indian Academy of Sciences (2014), the Distinguished Alumni Award from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (2019), and the United States Energy Secretary's Achievement Award (2018). It is natural to focus on the movement of charged ions in electric fields. In this talk however, I will focus on the movement of neutral \"solvent\" molecules used to dissolve the ions inside batteries. Any energy used to move solvent molecules is wasted, and thus it is important to understand how and why they move. In our case, the solvent is a polymer; I believe that polymer electrolytes will play an essential role in enabling next-generation rechargeable batteries. My journey began when I learned about the continuity equation as an undergraduate student. I will describe how the continuity equation changes in the presence of an electric field. While ion velocities can be inferred from current-voltage measurements, there were no well-established approaches for measuring velocities of neutral molecules in batteries. My group (and others) have recently developed experimental approaches for accomplishing this. Surprisingly, the field-induced velocity of uncharged long polymer chains is comparable to that of the ions. If the polymer chains are crosslinked, then the movement of ions generates stress that opposes ion motion. Theoretical predictions will be compared with experimental results. In addition to continuum-scale experiments, I will describe the results of quasi-elastic neutron scattering experiments which enable the study of the motion of polymer segments in the vicinity of ions on the Angstrom length scale. These measurements and computer simulations on the same length scale provide insight into the underpinnings of continuum transport. I will conclude by describing the connection between our work on polymer electrolytes and the continuing push to commercialize all-solid rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles and other energy-related applications.",

Dr. Shenoy's research focuses on developing theoretical concepts and numerical methods to understand the basic principles that control the behavior of biological systems. He has used rigorous analytical methods and multiscale modeling techniques, ranging from molecular to continuum methods, to gain physical insight into a myriad of problems in mechanobiology and biomaterials. He is the principal investigator and director of the NSF-funded Science and Technology Center for Engineering Mechanobiology established in 2016 and an MPI of the National Cancer Institute-funded Metastasis Research Network (MetNet) center funded in 2021. Shenoy is an ISI Web of Science/Clarivate Analytics Highly Cited Researcher. Abstract: The genome inside our cells is not a static string of DNA but a highly organized, dynamic structure shaped by biochemical reactions, physical forces, and tiny building blocks of chromatin. Recent work shows that active gene activity and epigenetic processes help organize chromatin at multiple scales -- from the mesoscale patterns revealed by super-resolution imaging and sequencing to nanoscale \"domains\" that act as hubs of transcription and regulatory activity, even in the absence of classical loop structures. These chromatin domains, visible only with advanced microscopy, appear to integrate local chemical marks with larger nuclear architecture, linking small-scale organization to global genome function. Importantly, disruptions in these organizing principles -- whether through altered mechanical cues, epigenetic misregulation, or pathological remodeling -- are increasingly observed in diseases like cancer and fibrosis, where genome structure and gene regulation go awry.
