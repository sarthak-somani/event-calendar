Speaker's webpage: https://chep.iisc.ac.in/Personnel/pages/anant/index.html Abstract: In this talk, we shall discuss the project of knowledge production as a profession and as a career, and the calling of a professional. We will present general arguments by looking into some contemporary examples drawn from different disciplines. We will described at a popular level recent discoveries such as gravitational waves which unites physics at the largest and smallest scales and the discovery of the Higgs boson which required a heroic man made machine. We will appeal to other examples from mathematics, computer science, biology, climate science, to name a few to motivate the challenges of the present era. We will also look into the issues of the psychology of creativity. Of importance are also questions of science and engineering in India as a developing country and that of representation of women among others. We will also touch on important issues of the role of the individual, of working in teams, and of communication. Stated differently this talk aims to provide a motivational framework and spells out the gestalt needed for a young person to enter the daunting field of research and discovery and to be a part of the great discoveries that lie ahead. The talk is aimed at a very broad audience and is accessible even to class XI and XII students, and for students across all B. Tech, M.Sc, Ph.D. students in all branches of sciences, and also to teachers and researchers in all areas of science. The speaker is well suited for this as someone with experience in both engineering and science. We wish to leave a lot of time for discussion at the end of the talk and encourage participation from all, young and not so young.",
